# Data-Science-Projects 🐋📊 📈 📉
This is one of my data science projects (exploration of my interesting stock market by using LSTM to predict stock prices). The goal is practicing, revising the steps or process of using a machine learning model, and analyzing it with the basic statistical method.

# Suggestions
- Improve the model by tuning parameters in the LSTM model
- Apply and create more features to improve the model's performance
- The most important is money management
- Try to solve the stock market problem with other questions like classification and clustering.
